    "title": "Creating My Academic Website with Quarto",
    "section": "The Conversion Process",
    "text": "The Conversion Process\n\nFrom Jekyll to Quarto\nThe conversion was surprisingly straightforward:\n\nConfiguration: I replaced _config.yml with _quarto.yml, which defines the site structure, navigation, and theme.\nContent: My CV (index.md) became index.qmd with just a YAML header addition. All the Markdown content stayed identical - Quarto is fully compatible with standard Markdown.\nTheme: I chose the cosmo theme for its clean, professional appearance. It’s similar to Jekyll’s minimal theme but more customizable.\nBlog Setup: I created a blog.qmd listing page that automatically aggregates posts from the posts/ directory, sorted chronologically.\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions Deployment\nThe biggest change was setting up automated deployment via GitHub Actions. Jekyll builds automatically on GitHub Pages, but Quarto requires a workflow file:\n# .github/workflows/publish.yml\nname: Publish Quarto Website\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nThis workflow: - Triggers on every push to the main branch - Installs Quarto - Renders the site - Deploys to the gh-pages branch\n\n\nRepository Configuration\nTwo critical GitHub settings were required:\n\nActions Permissions: Settings → Actions → General → Set “Read and write permissions”\nPages Source: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch: gh-pages / root"

    "title": "Creating My Academic Website with Quarto",
    "section": "What I Learned",
    "text": "What I Learned\n\nChallenges\nGitHub Actions Permissions: Initially, my workflow failed because GitHub Actions didn’t have write permissions. The fix was simple but not immediately obvious.\nBranch Deployment: I chose the gh-pages branch approach over the docs/ folder method. It keeps the main branch cleaner and follows standard conventions.\n\n\nBenefits\nMarkdown Compatibility: All my existing content worked perfectly - no reformatting needed.\nExtensibility: I can now easily add computational content, interactive visualizations, and more sophisticated layouts as my needs grow.\nProfessional Appearance: The site looks polished and modern, which is important for making a good impression on potential collaborators and employers."
