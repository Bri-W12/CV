## Why Quarto?

As a graduate student in Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology at Penn State, I needed a professional website to showcase my CV and share updates about my research. I initially started with a simple Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site, but I wanted something more flexible and powerful.

Enter [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) - an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that's perfect for academics. Here's why I made the switch:

### Key Advantages

1. **Computational Integration**: Quarto can embed R, Python, and Julia code, which is perfect for sharing research analyses and visualizations in future blog posts.

2. **Superior PDF Export**: I can easily export my CV to PDF with consistent formatting - essential for job applications and conference submissions.

3. **Modern Tooling**: Quarto is actively developed by Posit (formerly RStudio) and has excellent documentation and community support.

4. **Unified Publishing**: One system for websites, presentations, papers, and books. As I progress through my PhD, I can use Quarto for dissertation chapters, posters, and more.

## The Conversion Process

### From Jekyll to Quarto

The conversion was surprisingly straightforward:

1. **Configuration**: I replaced `_config.yml` with `_quarto.yml`, which defines the site structure, navigation, and theme.

2. **Content**: My CV (`index.md`) became `index.qmd` with just a YAML header addition. All the Markdown content stayed identical - Quarto is fully compatible with standard Markdown.

3. **Theme**: I chose the `cosmo` theme for its clean, professional appearance. It's similar to Jekyll's minimal theme but more customizable.

4. **Blog Setup**: I created a `blog.qmd` listing page that automatically aggregates posts from the `posts/` directory, sorted chronologically.

### GitHub Actions Deployment

The biggest change was setting up automated deployment via GitHub Actions. Jekyll builds automatically on GitHub Pages, but Quarto requires a workflow file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Quarto Website

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This workflow:
- Triggers on every push to the main branch
- Installs Quarto
- Renders the site
- Deploys to the `gh-pages` branch

### Repository Configuration

Two critical GitHub settings were required:

1. **Actions Permissions**: Settings → Actions → General → Set "Read and write permissions"
2. **Pages Source**: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch: `gh-pages` / `root`

## What I Learned

### Challenges

**GitHub Actions Permissions**: Initially, my workflow failed because GitHub Actions didn't have write permissions. The fix was simple but not immediately obvious.

**Branch Deployment**: I chose the `gh-pages` branch approach over the `docs/` folder method. It keeps the main branch cleaner and follows standard conventions.

### Benefits

**Markdown Compatibility**: All my existing content worked perfectly - no reformatting needed.

**Extensibility**: I can now easily add computational content, interactive visualizations, and more sophisticated layouts as my needs grow.

**Professional Appearance**: The site looks polished and modern, which is important for making a good impression on potential collaborators and employers.

## Future Plans

Now that the infrastructure is in place, I plan to use this blog for:

- Sharing updates about my research on IS1-mediated chromosomal amplification in *E. coli*
- Documenting computational methods and analyses
- Writing about conferences and workshops I attend
- Sharing insights about graduate school in BMMB
