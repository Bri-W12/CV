## Royce's DNA Results Are In!

I recently decided to get my cat, Royce, DNA tested, and the results were fascinating! It turns out that Royce is 23% Maine Coon.

When I first adopted Royce, I always wondered about his background since he is physically larger and has a different personality than my other cats. The DNA test was surprisingly easy to do - just a simple cheek swab - and the wait for results was worth it.

Learning that nearly a quarter of Royce's genetic makeup comes from Maine Coon heritage explains so much about his personality and physical traits. Maine Coons are known for being gentle giants with dog-like personalities, and Royce definitely exhibits some of these characteristics.
